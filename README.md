# Nuxt start kit v1

## Internationalization

-The project has the i18n module installed for Nuxt 3.

-Even if you only have one language at the initial stage, do not remove the module. Instead, develop the project with it in mind. This way, adding support for additional languages in the future will take only a few minutes.

-In nuxt.config.ts, configure the parameters for i18n based on the specific requirements of your project.

## Stylization

We use only logical properties. Forget about margin-left and similar properties.

## Strapi URL

Change ".env copy" file to ".env". Than set real address for your strapi project
