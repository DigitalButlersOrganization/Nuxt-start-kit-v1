# Nuxt start kit v1

<br/>

## Internationalization

<br/>

- The project has the i18n module installed for Nuxt 3.

- Even if you only have one language at the initial stage, do not remove the module. Instead, develop the project with it in mind. This way, adding support for additional languages in the future will take only a few minutes.

- In nuxt.config.ts, configure the parameters for i18n based on the specific requirements of your project.

- In the "locales" folder, translation files are stored. Avoid nesting deeper than three levels. Strive to maintain a balance between creating a clear hierarchy of entities and preventing excessively deep nesting.

## Stylization

<br/>

- Use only logical properties. Forget about margin-left and similar properties.
